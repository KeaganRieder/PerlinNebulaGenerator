# Perlin Nebula Generator

A Unity-based procedural art generator that creates stunning nebula visualizations using Perlin noise algorithms.  This project explores the intersection of computational randomness and artistic creation.

## Overview

This project was created in Unity for an art class assignment focused on creating art from randomness. It demonstrates how Perlin noise generation techniques can be used to produce beautiful, organic-looking nebula patterns that simulate the appearance of cosmic clouds in space.

Each generation produces a unique nebula with varying colors, density, and structure—making every result one-of-a-kind. 

## Features

- **Procedural Generation**: Creates unique nebula patterns using Perlin noise algorithms
- **Real-time Rendering**: Generates new nebulas on demand
- **Auto-regeneration**: Optional automatic refresh mode for continuous visualization
- **Interactive Controls**: Simple keyboard controls for easy interaction

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `A` | Toggle auto-reroll mode (generates new nebula approximately every 3 seconds) |
| `R` | Manually generate a new nebula |
| `ESC` | Quit application |

## Requirements

- Unity (version used during development should be specified)
- Compatible with Windows/Mac/Linux builds

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KeaganRieder/PerlinNebulaGenerator.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Unity
3. Press Play in the Unity Editor or build the project for your target platform

## Technical Details

This project leverages Perlin noise, a gradient noise function commonly used in procedural generation. The algorithm creates smooth, natural-looking patterns that are perfect for simulating organic phenomena like nebulas, clouds, and terrain.
